# Web3 Basics

### What is this about?
It's just for me to practice some basic web3 and ethereum stuff. 

Here I've written a smart contract and deployed it to the Rinkeby TestNet. Also developed a basic frontend to interact with the smart contract. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
